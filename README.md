# cablemodemutil

A CLI (written in go) for querying the status of Cable Modems.

This currently only works (and has been tested with) an Arris S33 Cable
Modem. The CLI uses the [cablemodemutil go library](https://github.com/Tuxdude/cablemodemutil)
for interacting with the cable modem.

If you would like to add support for other cable modems, please
file an Issue or submit a pull request with details for further discussion.
